# AS-TestDataScience-2

Welcome to the documentation for the **AS-TestDataScience-2** project.

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for forecasting energy consumption in a smart home using multivariate time series. It includes:

- EDA and seasonality analysis
- Stationarity verification (ADF, FFT, rolling statistics)
- Training of LSTM, Transformer, and TCN models
- Evaluation metrics and visual comparisons

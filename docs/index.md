# AS-TestDataScience-2

Welcome to the documentation for the **AS-TestDataScience-2** project.

This project builds a deep learning forecasting pipeline on the **Appliances Energy Prediction** dataset (UCI).  
It includes preprocessing, stationarity checks, modeling, and evaluation using LSTM, Transformer, and TCN models.

## 🔍 Main Features

- Clean and structured pipeline using the [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) template
- Extensive **EDA** and **seasonality detection**
- Thorough **stationarity testing** using visual and statistical tools
- Implementation of three deep learning architectures:
  - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - **Transformer**
  - **TCN** (Temporal Convolutional Network)
- Reproducible training and evaluation setup
- Clear metrics: **MAE** and **RMSE** reported for each model
